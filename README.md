# Hangman Game - Java Swing

## Description

This simple implementation of the classic Hangman game uses Java and Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game allows users to guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. The objective is to guess the word before the number of incorrect attempts reaches the allowed limit.

## Features

- Play a standard Hangman game with a random word selection.
- A graphical interface built using Java Swing for an interactive experience.
- Displays the current word with an asterisk (*) for unguessed letters.
- Visual representation of incorrect attempts (i.e. drawing a hangman figure).
- Input validation (only accepts single letters).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
      - git clone <https://github.com/sathwikhbhat/hangman.git>

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or any Java IDE you choose.
2. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. This project was developed using JDK version 8 or higher.
3. Build and run the project:
    - In IntelliJ, click the green "Run" button, or navigate to Run -> Run 'Hangman'.

## Usage

1. Run the Hangman.java file.
2. The game will display a GUI where you can see the blanks for each letter of the word.
3. Select one letter at a time in the provided input field.
4. The game will show if the guessed letter is correct or not, and update the game board accordingly.
5. The game will terminate when either the word is completely guessed or the number of incorrect attempts exceeds the allowed limit.


## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core programming language used for logic and gameplay.
